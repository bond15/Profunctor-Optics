-- Traversal

-- A traversable datatype is a containter datatype 
-- where the constructors of the container have an ordering

-- ex1) Maybe = Nothing | Just _ has a trivial traversal
-- with the ordering Just -> Nothing

-- ex2) List = Nil | Cons _ List, there is a linear traversal 
-- from the ordering of Cons to Nil

-- ex3) Tree = Leaf | Node Tree _ Tree
-- can have a preorder, inorder, postorder traversal

data Tree a = Leaf | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a) deriving (Show, Eq)

tree :: Tree Integer
tree =  Node (Node (Node Leaf 3 Leaf) 4 (Node Leaf 5 Leaf)) 6 (Node Leaf 7 Leaf)

-- traversals can also be effectful
inorder :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> Tree a -> f (Tree b)
inorder m Leaf = pure Leaf
inorder m (Node l x r) = pure Node <*> inorder m l <*> m x <*> inorder m r

preorder :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> Tree a -> f (Tree b)
preorder m Leaf = pure Leaf
preorder m (Node l x r) = undefined

-- Example State useage

    fmap f m = State(\s -> let (x ,s') = run m s in (f x, s'))

instance Applicative (State s) where
    pure x = State(\s -> (x,s))
    (<*>) m n = State(\s -> let (f,s') = run m s
                                (x,s'')= run n s'

-- a State that keeps a record of every element it sees
app :: a -> State [a] a
app = \a -> State(\s -> (a,s ++ [a]))

runEmpty = \state -> run state []

-- Do an inorder traversal of a tree, 
-- using State to keep a log of the elements visited 
logTree = runEmpty $ inorder app tree
logg = snd logTree

-- For an applicative functor F, 
--  a traversal takes an effectful opperation of type A -> F B 
-- on the elements of a container and lifts this to an effectful
-- computation of types S -> F T over the whole container



-- 2.3 Traversals as concrete optics
-- Ovserve the type (A -> F B) -> (S -> F T) 
--   of witnesses to traversability of the container S

-- is almost equivalent to a pair of functions

-- contents :: S -> A^n
    -- yileds the sequence of elements in the container
        -- in the order specified by a traversal
-- fill :: S x B^n -> T
    -- takes an old container and a new sequence of elements
        -- upddates the old container with new elements

-- where n is the number of elements in the container

-- when n = 1,   S -> A    S x B -> T

-- no dependent types here so cant index a type with n
-- workaround involves an existentially quantified length and 
-- tupling the contents and fill functions

-- Claim : S is equivalent to  Exists n. A^n x (B^n -> T)

type Optic p a b s t = p a b -> p s t

-- S and T are composite types
-- S has components of type A
-- T has components of type B
-- P A B is a transformation from A to B
-- An Optic lifts , for some particual choice of p, the transformation 
    -- from A to B into a transformation from S to T

-- Recall the Adapter s t a b = Adapter {from :: s -> a, to :: b -> t}

type AdapterP a b s t = forall p. Profunctor p => Optic p a b s t

-- these two definitions are equivalent  (see appendix C)

-- conversion
